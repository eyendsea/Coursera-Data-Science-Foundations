# Coursera-Data-Science-Foundations

Greetings!

  This repository was created mainly for the purpose of completing the Specialization entitled Data Science: Foundations using R in Coursera.
  The files in this will mainly revolve around the practice samples, exercises, projects etc. included within the said course as well as some of my experiments regarding the use of R.
  
  I do not guarantee that everything in this repository is correct. I welcome any constructive criticisms and questions with my work to better myself in this field.
  Thank you!
